    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Shanty's bakery began in 1978 as a small family kitchen in the hearts of Krugersdorp.<br> Founded by Shanty and John Duke, the bakery started with a single oven and a passion to make fresh homemade pastries and cakes for the neighbors but later in life it became a big part of the community through its customers.<br> The bakery is known for its commitment to produce high quality ingredients and a taste that no one can forget.<br> The bakery is having a challenge of not having a website relying on walk-in customers.</p>
    <p>Our mission is to bring joy to the community through delicious, affordable and fresh baked goods made with love and care.</p>
    <p>We see the bakery as the most loved bakery in krugersdorp, known for its quality and warm customer service.</p>
