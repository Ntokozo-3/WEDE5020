Feedback from Part1
File and Folder structure is organized but could be improved
Fixes- Images and documents are all in their own folder.

Feedback- semantic elements are used correctly but there are minor arrors or inconsistencies.
        -The structure is logical and mostly organized.
fixes- Use the semantics where they belong for example <section> is on a group related content not single paragraphs.
